Basic Gameplay Requirements
Our game has music and sound effects where appropriate. Our gameplay is in the correct amount of time. We remade one level as well as a boss fight.

Art
All of our art was made by our team. Our game has at least three different sprites (character projectile, character charged shot, and boss projectile to name three) as
well as an animated character with a background and a particle effect.

Code
The game is playable with the keyboard. Our game has three signifigant mechanics from the original megaman game in the form of the base projectile, a charged shot, and 
wall jumping.

Tech
Our levels are fully functional and complete. Our game has all the correct menus needed for this assignment. There are no dead ends in the levels or the menus in our
game.

Other Game Elements
Our group collaborated on the sound design, we went for the sounds that would work with the game the most. We talked about progression management, and we decided that
we wanted the player to teleport to the boss area. We all decided where to best fit enemies for our game. We also decided as a group how the controls should feel
and we decided that a standard platformer control layout would be good for our game. For enemy behavior, we decided to keep it basic as the experience should focus more
on Mega Man and not the enemies.
